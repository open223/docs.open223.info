RDF is a general method for representic semantic information in the form of a triple, which consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The subject and object define two entities, which are a instances of some class, and the predicate defines how they are related. A collection of these triples make up a graph. The 223 standard defines classes and relationships relevant to the building space that can then be used to build a multi-graph representing a specific building or group of buildings.
