The topology diagram below illustrates various concepts and relations relevant to establishing connections. Building upon this general diagram, the following sections will detail incremental changes and provide examples to illustrate the progression of complexity. As shown in the topology diagram, predicates are defined at different levels of abstraction. This diagram demonstrates how various concepts in the standard describe connectivity between two Connectables. Some predicates are exclusive to connections between Connectable and ConnectionPoints, such as hasConnectionPoint, while others only apply between ConnectionPoints and Connections, like connectsAt. However, the generic “cnx” relation can describe connectivity between any concept involved, including Connectable, Connection, and ConnectionPoint. It’s crucial to note that all other predicates can be inferred from the “cnx” predicate.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"cfCYRejflq"}],"key":"KSXTElajFj"},{"type":"image","url":"/build/guides-TopologyDiagr-2b32a89b1eb846740c576f6b603b6f4a.png","alt":"TopologyDiagram","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"qREtP0BhSd","urlSource":"images/guides-TopologyDiagram.png"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Minimum Connection Requirements for Equipment","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"key":"l2VOFo5TAE"}],"identifier":"minimum-connection-requirements-for-equipment","label":"Minimum Connection Requirements for Equipment","html_id":"minimum-connection-requirements-for-equipment","implicit":true,"key":"lJzkZjuQPX"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In this example, we demonstrate a straightforward use case: creating the initial element of a connection.
